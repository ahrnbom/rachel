to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, 
and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following two conditions:

Condition 1:
The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, 
DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE 
OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

Condition 2:
Any person or organization directly using the Software must, in some way, shape or form, publicly express negative emotions, such as hatred, 
disapproval, disgust, loathing or frustration, towards the Robot Operating System ("ROS") project, for a sufficiently long amount of time that 
some third party would be able to notice it. This condition is only valid for as long as the ROS project is in development, defined here as there
being a ROS version release within the last three years. In such a time when the ROS project is no longer actively developed, this condition should
be considered automatically fulfilled for any party.

For clarity, the following examples are shown here to illustrate how one might fulfill, or not fulfill, this condition.

Example 1: Person A wants to use the Software for her personal project. She uploads a 2 minute video on YouTube expressing frustration and 
some pain points of using ROS. This fulfills the condition.

Example 2: Person B is working for Company C. Person B decides to use the Software for their work project. Person B writes "ROS BAD" on a 
piece of paper and tapes it up to the office window, facing the outside street. This paper is kept there for two days, giving people outside
a chance to see it. This fulfills the condition.

Example 3: Person D lives alone on a remote island. There is no other people nearby, and she has no regular access to the internet or
other commonly used forms of communication. She wants to use the Software, so she places rocks on the beach in the shape of the letters
"I DON'T LIKE ROS", which could possible be seen from an airplane. This fulfills the condition. 

Example 4: Person E wants to use the Software. She puts a sign on her desk that reads "I HATE ROS". The desk it not clearly visible
for third parties except for those who are inside her house, which is not considered public for the purposes of this license. Therefore,
this does not fulfill the condition.
